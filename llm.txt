added

We have introduced support for multiple Merchant IDs (MIDs), enabling customers to seamlessly manage multiple merchant and sub-merchant accounts within a single integration.

Currently, the customers are identified based on authorisation, but with this enhancement, customers can pass an MID in request headers to specify the merchant or sub-merchant context for various API operations.

#### **Key Enhancements:**   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://docs.transfi.com/changelog/multiple-mid-support-for-customers-1\#key-enhancements)

1. #### **MID-Based Selection**   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://docs.transfi.com/changelog/multiple-mid-support-for-customers-1\#mid-based--selection)


- Customers can now pass **MID** in the request headers to determine the merchant or sub-merchant context for

  - User Creation
  - Prefunding
  - Order Creation
  - Order Details Retrieval
  - Balance Fetching
- If MID is not provided in the headers, the default MID assigned for the Customer will be used.
- Users must be explicitly created for each MID, even if they exist in other MIDs of the Customer.
- **New Request Field: mid** (optional) in request headers.

2. #### **Error Handling**   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://docs.transfi.com/changelog/multiple-mid-support-for-customers-1\#error-handling)







| Case | Error Code | HTTP Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MID is passed, but not linked to the customer | `MID_NOT_FOUND` | `404 Not Found` |
| MID is passed, but is disabled | `MID_DISABLED` | `401 Unauthorized` |

3. #### **Dashboard Updates**   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://docs.transfi.com/changelog/multiple-mid-support-for-customers-1\#dashboard-updates)


- If **MID** is provided → Returns details of the specified MID’s organization.
- If **MID** is not provided → Returns **aggregated** details across all linked MIDs.

4. #### **Dashboard Updates**   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://docs.transfi.com/changelog/multiple-mid-support-for-customers-1\#dashboard-updates-1)


Dashboard will have the new column `MID` on the Users and Orders masters and the view can be filtered with the new column `MID`.

5. #### **Why This Matters?**   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://docs.transfi.com/changelog/multiple-mid-support-for-customers-1\#why-this-matters)


- **Unified Account Management:** Customers no longer need to create separate accounts for each MID. A single account can now handle multiple MIDs efficiently.
- **Seamless API Integration:** Customers can maintain a single API integration and differentiate transactions, balances, and users by passing an MID in headers.
- **Improved Dashboard Experience:** Customers can view and manage balances across all MIDs in one dashboard, eliminating the need to switch between multiple accounts.
- **Flexibility for Business Expansion:** Customers can easily request additional MIDs for their merchants or sub-merchants as needed.
- **Future Enhancements:** This implementation lays the foundation for future capabilities, including inter-MID balance transfers (not included in this release).

#### **Impact on Existing Customers:**   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://docs.transfi.com/changelog/multiple-mid-support-for-customers-1\#impact-on-existing-customers)

- **Backward Compatibility:** No breaking changes. The existing integration will work without any abruption.
- **MID issuance:** We will start issuing the MIDs for customers who already had multiple MIDs through different accounts. Customers can migrate to the new MIDs without affecting the current integration, and all other accounts will remain active until the migration is completed on the customer's end.

#### **Live Date:** 04-March-2025   [Skip link to [object Object], 04-March-2025](https://docs.transfi.com/changelog/multiple-mid-support-for-customers-1\#live-date-04-march-2025)

improved

We have made an important update to the **Fiat Payin Orders** API to improve modularity and flexibility.

Previously, the `Fiat Payin Orders` API allowed the creation of both the user and the transaction in a single API call. This functionality has now been split into two separate APIs:

**Step 1: Create Individual API**

Use this API to create a user account in TransFi.

- **Endpoint:** `/v2/users/individual`
- **Description:** This API creates a user profile and returns a `userId` in the response.

**Step 2: Create Deposit Order API**

Use this API to create a transaction for the user account created in the previous step.

- **Endpoint:** `/v2/orders/deposit` and `/v2/orders/gaming`
- **Description:** Use the `email` from the `Create User API` to initiate a deposit order.

### Impact on Existing Customers   [Skip link to Impact on Existing Customers](https://docs.transfi.com/changelog/split-api-for-deposit-order-creation\#impact-on-existing-customers)

#### Breaking Change   [Skip link to Breaking Change](https://docs.transfi.com/changelog/split-api-for-deposit-order-creation\#breaking-change)

The **Fiat Payin Orders** endpoint will no longer support on creating the user account after **April 7, 2025**. Requests will fail with the following error message and HTTP status code **404**:

```

--- docs_transfi_com_docs_3_EF_B8_8F_E2_83_A3_webhook_signature.txt ---

All webhooks sent from TransFi are signed with a dedicated secret that is known only by TransFi and Customers. This ensures the integrity of the data contained in the webhook.

> ### 📘  NOTE
>
> Please connect with our tech support team to know your webhook dedicated secret key.

We are using HMAC or Hashed Message Authentication Code, as an authentication method with two keys.

First key is the `HTTP Request Body`

Second is the `Dedicated Secret key`

### How does Webhook Signature works:   [Skip link to How does Webhook Signature works:](https://docs.transfi.com/docs/3%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3-webhook-signature\#how-does-webhook-signature-works)

Use the following code snippet to generate the hash using `dedicated secret key + body` and compare it with the signature has received from `X-Transfi-Hmac-Hash`

If the generated hash from Customer matched with the value received from `X-Transfi-Hmac-Hash`, then the message is `valid` one. If it is not matched, then the message is the `invalid` one.

```rdmd-code lang-undefined theme-light
Customer can skip these events.

To acknowledge receipt of an event, your endpoint must return a 200 HTTP status code to TransFi. If an event is not acknowledged by returning a 200 HTTP status code to TransFi, we will retry the webhook for upto 2 hours with regular interval.

We understand any server can be degraded, unavailable, or outage under very rare circumstances. TransFi provides automatic retry feature to help you to reconcile webhook events after an incident has been resolved on your end.

### Automatic Retry \#   [Skip link to Automatic Retry \#](https://docs.transfi.com/docs/4%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3-webhook-retry\#automatic-retry-)

Webhook automatic retry feature is enabled by default for all customers.

> ### 📘  Note
>
> Automation retry logic works if there is a timeout or if the webhook connection fails for any of the webhooks. The webhook should be retried 8 times, at intervals of 15 minutes.

Any failed events will be automatically retry for 2h with exponential backoff interval. The table below shows detail of interval between retries:

| Retry Number | Interval (relative to last retry) |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 15 min |
| 2 | 15 min |
| 3 | 15 min |
| 4 | 15 min |
| 5 | 15 min |

To use Basic Authentication in Postman, open your request and navigate to the Authorization tab. Select "Basic Auth" from the dropdown menu, then enter your username and password in the provided fields. Postman will automatically encode your credentials into a Base64 format and include them in the Authorization header. Once done, you can send the request to authenticate and access the API securely. For added security, consider using environment variables to manage credentials.

This is a quick start guide for adding fiat payments with the wallet flow to your checkout with TransFi. We will walk step by step through the process to collect fiat user from the users and be updated on the payment status all the way.

This is a special case where we accept Payin in some specific payment methods using a wallet in between the user and merchant. The settlement will be in a batch in a pre agreed crypto wallet address or bank account for a batch of transactions.

### Before you start:   [Skip link to Before you start:](https://docs.transfi.com/docs/building-a-checkout-for-payments-with-specific-european-payment-methods\#before-you-start)

Make sure you've followed the getting setup steps so that you have your account setup, API keys ready, and a username and password shared with you already. We won't be going through these steps in the guide.

You can start the process here, it won't take long.

This flow is intended to be integrated if you intend to use the below payment methods only

1. Skrill
2. Neteller
3. Cards
4. Open Banking
5. Blik

If you intend to user other payment methods, you can integrate the FIAT PAYIN Flow.

For this guide, we will be using the TransFi hosted page as this is the fastest way to accept fiat using above payment methods in your payment flows.

- **`POST /orders/gaming`** [API](https://docs.transfi.com/reference/createcollectionorderwithwallet-1#/)


Create a payin order for any of the enabled payment methods.

The `payment_code` & `payment_type` field within the [Create Payin with wallet payload](https://docs.transfi.com/reference/createcollectionorderwithwallet#/) , allows merchants to specify which exact payment method are available for the end user to make payment. This field is not mandatory; however, if provided, it restricts the method that can be used for the transaction.

If `payment_code` & `payment_type` is not specified, the end user will have the option to make the payment using any of the enabled payment methods.


1. **Request payload without payment code and payment type :**

JSON

```rdmd-code lang-json theme-light

{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "johndoee@transfi.com",

  "partnerContext": {}
}
```

- **Sending your user to pay with the redirectURL**

In the previous step, we created our payment. At the end of that step, we received a response from the API with all the payment details, and in this step, we will be using the `paymentUrl`.


After you've successfully created the payment you will need to redirect your end-user to the hosted page to make their payment. After redirecting, there's nothing to do but wait!

Choose payment method

Enter deposit amount and click on continue

In the above mentioned step, a wallet in the name of the user is created by TransFi. The fiat payin is done in two parts, with one part being onramp to the newly created wallet.

Transfer from user wallet to merchant

The above screenshot represents the next leg of the transaction where the wallet is topped you and the next step is to give consent to move funds out of this wallet and settle with the merchant as per agreement. This marks the final leg of the transaction.

The deposit direction allows you to collect funds from users into the platform, while the withdraw direction facilitates transferring funds from the platform to users. To retrieve a list of supported currencies for either transaction type, you can send a GET request to the respective endpoint, specifying the direction as a query parameter (direction=deposit or direction=withdraw).

There are two ways to get this done.

- **Listening for payment webhooks**


We covered how to create a webhook listener [here](https://docs.transfi.com/update/docs/configuring-a-webhook-listener#/) in the getting setup guide - if you haven't done this already, go back to this step to get ready to receive webhooks.
- **Retrieve the order by it’s ID**

`GET /orders/{orderID}`
You can retrieve directly the latest status by specifying the order ID in the `GET` Request.

Our KYC API simplifies the user verification process, increasing your conversion rate. We adhere to the highest global standards for AML and KYC and gather necessary documents from our customer's users using a risk-based approach.

Using our KYC endpoints, you can verify customers during sign-up or at their convenience. Once verified, they can make or receive payments without any extra steps during checkout.

This section is a guide for API users to retrieve a list of documents that have to be uploaded for a specified individual or company. It is mandatory for the sender of funds to be KYCed with relevant documents.

1. **Submit KYC using TransFi API:** You can directly KYC your users using TransFi API. We use Sumsub as our KYC provider and with the `/kyc/standard` endpoint you will get a URL to KYC your users directly with us.
2. **Share KYC through Sumsub Agreement:** TransFi and its clients can enter into a tripartite agreement with Sumsub and enable direct KYC sharing based on a common token. This endpoint facilitates seamless integration for sharing KYC.
3. **Share KYC from other KYC Partner:** If you do not use Sumsub as your KYC provider, fret not! You can pass the required KYC information directly to us and we will take care of the rest.
4. **Additional KYC Documents:** For higher transactional volumes after certain volumes are already paid in or out, it is necessary to collect additional documents and information on the sender of funds. Those requests can be fulfilled by sharing directly using this endpoint.

### Submit KYC using TransFi API:   [Skip link to Submit KYC using TransFi API:](https://docs.transfi.com/docs/kyc\#submit-kyc-using-transfi-api)

Below are the user experience for the direct KYC submission on TransFi. The specific documents required depends on the transaction volume and the jurisdiction of the sender/recepient of funds.

With Reusable KYC, the user details can be shared from our customer to TransFi to simplify and speed up verification for their users that have already passed it.

Such an approach minimizes onboarding drop-offs and enables your users to avoid repeat verification.

**How it works:**

Assume User A passed user verification in Customer (Service X) and is now registering at TransFi (Service Y). If Customer agrees to share information about User A with TransFi, it can
be done as follows:

1\. Customer generates a share token and passes it to TransFi.

2\. TransFi calls the API method with the received share token and obtains information
on user A with all its data and documents.

![](https://files.readme.io/96a40b70fcc565ea722969a018744a2ef9af5314906ef284fa8c651fe5d78d58-Screenshot_2024-11-26_at_7.51.58_PM.png)

**Customer generate share token using sumsub api**

cURL

```rdmd-code lang-Text theme-light

curl --request POST 'https://api.sumsub.com/resources/accessTokens/- /shareToken?applicantId={{sumsubApplicantId}}&forClientId=transfi.com_123'
```

The value for the param `sumsubApplicantId` can be obtained from Sumsub platform and `forClientId` will be shared by TransFi on the integration phase.

**Shared token on the response:**

JSON

```rdmd-code lang-Text theme-light

{
	"token": "_act-b8ebfb63-5f24-4b89-9c08-000000000000",
	"forClientId": " transfi.com_123"
}
```

**Making API request to share the KYC:**

cURL

```rdmd-code lang-Text theme-light

curl --request POST \
     --url https://sandbox-api.transfi.com/v2/kyc/share/same-vendor \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \

On a very high level (This can vary based on geo)

- Standard KYC / Level 1 requests for - ID doc, Selfie, Address, Phone number
- Enhanced KYC / Level 2 requests for - Proof of source of funds (PSoF), Address proof

Also there are transaction limits beyond which each KYC kicks in. It can be at a per transaction amount, sum of all transactions in a day, sum of all transactions in a month.

The webhook schema defines the structure of payloads sent by **TransFi** to notify your system about key events. These notifications are sent in real-time as **JSON objects** and are triggered at both the **user** and **order** levels.

Webhooks ensure your system stays updated with the latest status changes, providing all necessary details for seamless event processing.

#### Webhook Payload Structure   [Skip link to Webhook Payload Structure](https://docs.transfi.com/docs/webhook-schema\#webhook-payload-structure)

Each webhook payload contains the following key fields, offering crucial information about the event:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **entityType** | **String** | Specifies the type of entity triggering the event (user-level or order-level). |
| **entityId** | **String** | Unique Identifier of the event (user, order). |
| **status** | **String** | Current status of the entity. |
| **user** | **Object** | Contains user information relevant to the event. |
| **order** | **Object** | Contains order information relevant to the event. |

#### Supported Events   [Skip link to Supported Events](https://docs.transfi.com/docs/webhook-schema\#supported-events)
